Description:
The lattice has 8**4 sites and beta is chosen to be 5.5 in this simulation
100 sweeps have been at the beginning to thermalize the lattice
10 Configurations of the lattice have been saved
25 sweeps have been performed between each saved configuration to minimize the autocorrelation
Each link is updated 10 times each time that it is selected
The parameter that controls the deviation form the identity matrix of the random SU(3) elements has been 0.24 in this simulation and 100 random SU(3) matrices have been generated
